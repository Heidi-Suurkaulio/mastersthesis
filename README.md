# The Network of Power: family ties within the Swedish Council of the Realm

This is the GitHub page for my master's thesis in progress.
The aim of this work is to model the graph of family ties between the members of the Swedish Council of Realm.
My work is based on the database [Swedish Councillors of the Realm, 1523-1680](https://doi.org/10.17011/jyx/dataset/55523) collected by historians Marko Hakanen and Ulla Koskinen.
