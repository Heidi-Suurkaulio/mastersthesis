# Game of Networks: Family Ties Within the Swedish Council of the Realm (1523-1680)

This is the GitHub page for my master's thesis.
The aim of this work was to model the graph of family ties between the members of the Swedish Council of Realm.
My work is based on the database [Swedish Councillors of the Realm, 1523-1680](https://doi.org/10.17011/jyx/dataset/55523) collected by historians Marko Hakanen and Ulla Koskinen. The network analysis is mostly conducted with [Gephi](https://github.com/gephi) platform.

One cornerstone in my work was a simple Pyhton script which I made to extract the data from the dataset. The Python script, the Gephi projects and the thesis text itself are available in the folders above.
