# Notes for the Data Processing

- Remove excess data: sources and empty columns describing years active

- Modyfy namespaces: name 'No.' causes Python error because of the dot, Id is more friendly towards the script, "Family members in the council of the realm" is too verbose use "Family" instead

- How to verify that the data has been processed correctly (connections are to the right person), forever problem in programming and data science

- Found some 'ghost' nodes e.g. Id: 147, why?

- Where is "Lillienstedt, Johan (1655-1732) is he one of the "ghosts"

- 'timestamps' could be counted from year of appointment and year of death. The position was (usually) lifelong (Hakanen and Koskinen p. 52)
